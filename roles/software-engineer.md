# Software Engineer Hiring Process

At JazzHR, we want to create an interview process that allows candidates to perform at their full potential. We believe in being transparent around our hiring process and aim to give you all necessary information upfront to make you feel comfortable. We do not believe in random whiteboard algorithm challenges or trick questions. Everything you encounter in our hiring process should simulate real-life scenarios you could expect here at JazzHR.

This page explains our hiring process for Software Engineer roles. If you have any additional questions not covered on this page, feel free to reach out to your recruiter or our hiring team at any point.

## 1. Resume review

Apply to our open position on our [career page](https://careers.jazzhr.com/). Our hiring team will review your application and provide an update to you via email. This usually takes 2-3 days to hear back from us.

## 2. Recruiter screen

Our technical recruiter will contact you to schedule a short call to better understand your experience and what you are looking for in a new role.

## 3. Code challenge

We send you some instructions via email to complete a short coding assignment in your own time. We have no expectation of how quickly you respond to our code challenge. Take your time and put your best work forward, but don’t overthink it. Candidates typically complete the challenge in 2-4 hours. You can expect to hear back from us within 2 days after our hiring team reviews your code. Keep this submission handy we use it in a pair programming interview session.

We evaluate code submissions on the following criteria:
- Does the solution address the problem?
- Does the code account for edge cases?
- Is the code readable and easy to understand?
- Is the code testable and maintainable?
- Are we able to run the application using the documentation provided?

## 4. Interview
A member of our team will contact you to schedule an interview session with our hiring team. Our interview sessions will allow you to meet our team and allow us to understand how you work in real-life scenarios.

Our interview process is broken into the following interview sessions:
- back-end (50 minutes) - database design, API design, and software architecture
- front-end (50 minutes) - HTML and CSS fundamentals, Javascript, and basic web security
- pair-programming (50 minutes) - an interactive coding session iterating on functionality from the coding challenge assignment.
- manager interview (30 minutes) - meet with our VP of Engineering

## 5. Hiring decision
